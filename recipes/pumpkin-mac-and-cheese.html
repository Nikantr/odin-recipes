        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>366gr milk</li>
            <li>245gr pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>340.2gr fusilli</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 1/2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons minced thyme</li>
            <li>113.4gr shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>56.7gr shredded gouda</li>
            <li>30gr toasted panko</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Stir together milk and pumpkin puree.</li>

            <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Once the water comes to a boil add a generous amount of salt (2½ or 3 tablespoons) and then the pasta. Boil pasta for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta and set aside.</li>

            <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Sprinkle flour over melted butter and whisk together. Allow mixture to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in thyme.</li>

            <li>Whisk pumpkin-milk mixture into flour mixture and continue to whisk until fully incorporated. Allow mixture to simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Remove from heat and stir cheese into the béchamel sauce, in small handfuls, and stir until cheese just melts before adding more cheese.</li>

            <li>Reduce heat to low and gently stir pasta into the sauce, ½ cup at a time until all of the pasta has been added and is fully coasted in sauce. Adjust seasonings.</li>

            <li>Serve Pumpkin Mac and Cheese into bowls and top with fresh thyme and toasted panko.</li>
