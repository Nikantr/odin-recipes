        <h3>This version keeps better because it is a meatless version but doesn't lack in flavor because it uses good quality chicken broth.</h3>

        <p>It's best to have all of the ingredients prepped and ready to go which makes this soup super easy and care free. Start by peeling, grating, chopping, slicing and dicing all of the vegetables for borscht. Once your potatoes are peeled and sliced, transfer them to a bowl of cold water to keep them from discoloring until ready for use.</p>

        <p>We used to add cabbage but our children prefer it without so for years now we've been making it just like this without cabbage. If you prefer cabbage, add 1/4 to 1/2 small head of cabbage, thinly shredded, adding it when the potatoes are halfway cooked.</p>
